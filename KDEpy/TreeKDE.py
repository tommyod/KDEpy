class TreeKDE(BaseKDE):
    """
    This class implements a tree-based computation of a kernel density
    estimate. It works by segmenting the space recursively into smaller parts.

    This makes computing a kernel density estimate at a location easier, since
    we are able to query the tree structure for nearby points instead of having
    to evaluate the kernel function on all data points. For kernels without
    finite support, their support is approximated. The ``scipy`` k-d tree is
    used as the underlying algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel : str
        The kernel function. See cls._available_kernels.keys() for choices.
    bw : float, str or array-like
        Bandwidth or bandwidth selection method. If a float is passed, it
        is the standard deviation of the kernel. If a string it passed, it
        is the bandwidth selection method, see cls._bw_methods.keys() for
        choices. If an array-like it passed, it is the bandwidth of each
        point.
    norm : float
        The p-norm used to compute the distances in higher dimensions.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> data = np.random.randn(2**10)
    >>> # (1) Automatic bw selection using Improved Sheather Jones
    >>> x, y = TreeKDE(bw='ISJ').fit(data).evaluate()
    >>> # (2) Explicit choice of kernel and bw (standard deviation of kernel)
    >>> x, y = TreeKDE(kernel='triweight', bw=0.5).fit(data).evaluate()
    >>> weights = data + 10
    >>> # (3) Using a grid and weights for the data
    >>> y = TreeKDE(kernel='epa', bw=0.5).fit(data, weights).evaluate(x)

        Fit the KDE to the data. This validates the data and stores it.
        Computations are performed upon evaluation on a grid.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data: array-like
            The data points.
        weights: array-like
            One weight per data point. Numbers of observations must match
            the data points.

        -------

        """
        Evaluate on grid points.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_points: array-like, int, tuple or None
            A grid (mesh) to evaluate on. High dimensional grids must have
            shape (obs, dims). If an integer is passed, it's the number of grid
            points on an equidistant grid. If a tuple is passed, it's the
            number of grid points in each dimension. If None, a grid will be
            automatically created.
        eps: float
            The maximal total error in absolute terms when estimating the
            effective support of a kernel which has infinite support. Setting
            this too high will produced a jagged estimate.

        Returns
        -------
        y: array-like
            If a grid is supplied, `y` is returned. If no grid is supplied,
            a tuple (`x`, `y`) is returned.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> kde = TreeKDE().fit([1, 3, 4, 7])
        >>> # Two ways to evaluate, either with a grid or without
        >>> x, y = kde.evaluate()

        >>> y = kde.evaluate(x)
